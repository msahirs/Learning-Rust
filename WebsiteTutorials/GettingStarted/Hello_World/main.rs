To Execute, do the following in powershell or terminal (Windows)

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}



/*
The main function is special: it is always the first code that runs in every executable
Rust program. Here, the first line declares a function named main that has no parameters 
and returns nothing. If there were parameters, they would go inside the parentheses ().

The function body is wrapped in {}.
Rust requires curly brackets around all function bodies.
Itâ€™s good style to place the opening curly bracket on the same
line as the function declaration, adding one space in between.
