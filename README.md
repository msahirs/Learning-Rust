Hello!

Here's my scripts in trying to learn Rust :)

You'll find stuff from:

- Personal endeavours
- The Rust learn by example mdbook on the official site: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html
- TU Delft's course "Software Fundamentals (CESE4000)" and its mdbook: https://software-fundamentals.pages.ewi.tudelft.nl/website/index.html
